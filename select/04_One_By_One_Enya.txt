Here am I
Yet another goodbye
He says adios, says adios
And do you know why
She won't break down and cry?
She says adios, says adios, goodbye
One by one my leaves fall
One by one my tales are told
It's no lie
She is yearning to fly
She says adios, says adios
And now you know why
He's a reason to sigh
She says adios, says adios, goodbye
One by one my leaves fall
One by one my tales are told
My, oh my
She was aiming too high
He says adios, says adios
And now you know why
There's no moon in her sky
He says adios, says adios, goodbye
He says adios, says adios, goodbye
No goodbyes
For love brightens their eyes
Don't say adios, say adios
And do you know why
There's a love that won't die?
Don't say adios, say adios, goodbye
Don't say adios, say adios, goodbye
Don't say adios, say adios, goodbye
