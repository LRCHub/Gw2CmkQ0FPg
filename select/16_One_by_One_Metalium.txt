Only a fool would dare
To tease the gods and offend their sons
Too proud to understand
Danger for men, their time has come

Don't ever underrate their might
You pray for mercy loosing all your pride

One by one
Will be gone
One by one
End has come

They took revenge
For disrespectful words she's ever said
Her flesh and blood died in pain
They took all she ever had

Now after all she stands alone
Her graceful body trapped in stone
In stone

One by one
Will be gone
One by one
End has come

One by one
Will be gone
One by one
End has come

One by one
Will be gone
One by one
End has come

One by one
And now her graceful body trapped in stone
One by one
And now her graceful body trapped in stone

One by one
And now her graceful body trapped in stone
One by one
And now her graceful body trapped in stone
And now her graceful body trapped in stone
