[00:06.32] Pontius Pilot came to our town
[00:12.63] Up to the dockyards
[00:16.28] To see the picket line
[00:18.95] We asked him to help
[00:21.64] But he just turned around
[00:25.20] He's the leader of the union now
[00:41.20] 
[00:32.59] Leader of the union
[00:39.72] All of our questions he ignored
[00:46.08] He washed his hands
[00:48.85] And he dreamt of his reward
[00:52.42] A seat in the House of Lords
[01:06.42] 
[01:26.81] One by one
[01:30.42] The ships come sailing in
[01:34.99] One by one
[01:38.67] The ships go sailing out
[01:50.67] 
[01:45.85] We live for words and die for words
[01:50.34] Principles we can afford
[01:53.91] When all our brothers turn to Lords
[01:58.45] Whose side are you on?
[02:09.45] 
[02:03.00] You tell the world your hands are tied
[02:06.68] History three times denied
[02:11.16] A sea of changes, three miles wide
[02:15.69] Whose side are you on?
[02:26.69] 
[02:20.15] One by one
[02:23.88] The ships come sailing in
[02:28.32] One by one
[02:31.96] The ships go sailing out
[02:43.96] 
[02:39.16] This conspiracy of shame
[02:42.81] Murder by some other name
[02:47.35] Pay up and play the game
[02:51.85] Whose side are you on?
[03:02.85] 
[02:56.33] If any ask us why we died?
[02:59.98] We tell them that our leaders lied
[03:04.44] Sold us out, down the riverside
[03:09.09] Whose side are you on?
[03:20.09] 
[03:12.62] One by one
[03:17.14] The ships come sailing in
[03:21.68] One by one
[03:25.25] The ships go sailing out
[03:37.25] 
[03:46.63] One by one
[03:50.23] The ships come sailing in
[03:55.68] One by one
[03:59.25] The ships go sailing out
[04:11.25] 
[04:03.75] One by one
[04:08.07] The ships come sailing in
[04:12.52] One by one
[04:16.11] The ships go sailing out
[04:28.11] 
[04:20.71] One by one
[04:24.34] The ships come sailing in
[04:29.76] One by one
[04:33.32] The ships go sailing out
