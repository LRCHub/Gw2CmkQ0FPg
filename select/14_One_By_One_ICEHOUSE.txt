Here in this empty room, the memories will remain
You may never learn, you make the same mistakes again

One by one... You count them one by one...

Days that were lost and found, old memories will remain
Here in this empty room, you count them one by one

One by one... You count them one by one...

Here in this empty room, you count them one by one
Oh hoh... Oh hoh...

One by one... You count them one by one...
One by one... You count them one by one...

Here in this empty room (One by one) Old memories will remain
And you never learn (One by one)
You make the same mistake again (One by one)
Those days are lost and found
Memories may still (One by one) The memories will remain
You make the same mistake again (One by one)
[Here in this empty room] You count them one by one
